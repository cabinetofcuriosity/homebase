This repository is for Week 5 notebooks which is detailed here: [https://github.com/cabinetofcuriosity/homebase/issues/4](https://github.com/cabinetofcuriosity/homebase/issues/4).


## Activity 3: Start exploring your databases! 

- Due Oct 18

We will all meet one on one next week to discuss how you want to proceed with your project. To prepare for this interview. I understand that some of you are at different stages of your analysis, but do your best to hit these points.

This should all be done in a notebook and deposited in the 

1. Try and gauge the scope of the database.  How many types of animals? How many types of variables?  What are the measurements? Are there variables that are required for each data point? Try to explain in a programmatic way.
2. Data Quality: Are there ways to access the quality of this data?  For example, if there are geographic points, does it make sense that whales were found in the middle of Iowa? What are some assumptions that you have to make about this data? Are there clear documentation on the standards that are required to input data into this database? 

- Completeness:requires that a particular column, element or class of data is populated and does not feature null values or values in place of nulls (e.g. N/As).
- Consistency: something that tests whether one fact is consistent with another e.g. gender and title in a CRM database.
- Uniqueness: are all the entities or attributes within a dataset unique?
- Integrity: are all the relationships populated for a particular entity â€“ for example its parent or child entities?
- Conformity: does the data conform to the right conventions and standards.  For example a value may be correct but follow the wrong format or recognised standard.
- Accuracy: the hardest dimension to test for as this often requires some kind of manual checking by a Subject Matter Expert (SME).

2.  What are the variables that are most interesting to you? At some point you will need to refine the scope of your project. You likely cannot explore ALL the data.  Are their questions about the that are particularly interesting to you? Questions can either be about the quality of the data or of biological significance. 
3. Reiterate what skills you particullarly interested in learning. Do you see a clear path from this database to level up on those skills? 
4. If you are having a hard time understanding how to handle the data, is there a clear path for learning how? Is there something that could be done to the data on the database side that would make your life easier when using this data? Do you wish it was in json over XML? Do you wish that there was a tool in Python that would connect to the database?  Did you find the documentation incredibly hard to follow? What are some things you googled that helped you?  What are the things you googled that had no answer but wish there was?
