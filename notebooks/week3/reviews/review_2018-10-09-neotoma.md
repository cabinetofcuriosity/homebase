# Review for Neotoma

Nice job! I would first suggest a brief introduction and explanation of what the Neotoma database is and what it's useful for. Also, it would be great if you could specify what language you are using for this; it wasn't immediately clear for me when I tried to execute the first step. Also, maybe you could clarify what the data consists of and represents. Including the [documentation](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/neotoma-manual/latest/neotoma-manual.pdf) for the database would also be really helpful!

 Finally, I like that you displayed the table that is created from writing to a .csv. It would also be helpful if you explained what your code means (what it's accomplishing).
