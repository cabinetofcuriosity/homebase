I enjoyed reading through this tutorial! it was extremeley well-written, with comprehensive instructions and links. I was able to follow your instructions with no problems. I appreciated the background you gave to the database, and liked how you walked me through the beginning steps of the exploratory analysis. I fixed some typos, and there was one cell, BrukerSkyscan.show(), that was accidentally commented out. Also, when taking every tenth row of GenusGrouped, you actually took the 10th to 99th rows of the table (we discussed this on Friday). There is also a genus "21" in your GenusGroup table, which I'm confused about. It may also be helpful to note that you may want to convert the data stored in the "scan date" column of BrukerSkyscan to something more comprehensive. With single digit month and days, it may be unclear as to whether a date 3/2 is March 2 or February 3. Overall, the notebook is clear and all the links are working. Like I said on Friday, this is a great notebook!
