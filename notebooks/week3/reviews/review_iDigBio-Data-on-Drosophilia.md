Didn't find any spelling or grammar errors, and the instructions were very easy to follow. The provided images definitely helped in visualizing what was going on and where to access the data. Perhaps a more detailed description of the various parts/sections of the iDigBio search portal would add to the understanding of how iDigBio works. (i.e. specifiying the map interface and how to use the "Mapping" tab next to download, and the list of data at the bottom which you can select given the filtered inputs, although this may be relatively self-explanatory as well). 

What I do like is that the data is easily accessible and actually rather complete (at least for the drosophilia flies). It's also nice that they send a link to your email so that you have a backup copy with you. Additionally, since I'm working on the MorphoSource database, there's actually a link that takes you from the MorphoSource specimen that you are viewing and presenting the same species in iDigBio. (It's like a collaboration between the two database websites and you can see information about each individual specie (from MorphoSource) on the iDigBio portal, which would be very helpful in collecting the csv file/data for the 3D scans).
