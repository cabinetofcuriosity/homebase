# Review for Movebank

Use an appropriate title for your review, like above.

In the section where you write your reviews of the notebook you are interested in. As mentioned in [Week 4 and 5 tasks](https://github.com/cabinetofcuriosity/homebase/issues/4):

### Part 1: Read through each others notebook 

- Due October 11th

The ultimate goal is that your notebooks will eventually be turned into blog posts, possibly just about this first step - accessing this data. This will act as a tutorial for the whole world! Therefore, let's make sure we are as clear as possible. Many of you are at different stages on how to access the data, so feel free to contact me with further questions. In addition  I will be reading through everyone's note book and making notes myself.

- Look for spelling and grammar errors and fix through pull requests.
- Does this work make sense? Can you go through their code and directions to get the same data frame (or to the section they got to)?
- Are there areas in which need more clarification? Did you have to look something up? Can you add clarification to their work? A link to a tutorial, blog post, article or tutorial that helped you.
- What do you find interesting about the database?
